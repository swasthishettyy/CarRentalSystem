The Car Rental Platform is a Spring Boot-based web application that enables users to View available cars, Book cars, Make payments and Download reports. The platform uses Spring Security for authentication and Role-Based Access Control to restrict access to different features. All operations are secured using Basic Authentication, and user roles are stored in the database.
